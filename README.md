# React_Ecommerce
React_Ecommerce-main is a modern, responsive e-commerce front-end built with React. It's intended as a starter/learning project or a basis for a small store: product listing, cart, checkout flow (mocked), and basic state management. Clean structure and common tools make it easy to extend or plug into a real backend.
